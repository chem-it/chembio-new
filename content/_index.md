        ## Exploring Science, Nature and Culture

        I am researcher currently in the field of developing novel antivirals. On this page I will share my latest insights and perspectives on antiviral research, medicinal chemistry and organic chemistry. Currently based in the vibrant city of Hong Kong, I am eager to learn more about the local Cantonese culture. Therefore, I am not only exploring the city, but also traveling around Guangdong and learning Cantonese.
