        Inspired by natural products, their biosynthesis and impact in medicinal chemistry, I started to gain a better insight in the total synthesis of these unique molecules. After my diploma thesis in the field of organocatalysis under supervision of Prof Rainer Mahrwald (HU Berlin), I continued with the total synthesis of complex polyketides during my PhD thesis under supervision of Prof Dirk Menche (University of Bonn). After a short research stay at the TU Dresden at Prof Peter Metz's Lab, I was able to join the group of Prof Pauline Chiu at Hong Kong University and I am now Postdoc at the research group of Prof Billy Ng at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
